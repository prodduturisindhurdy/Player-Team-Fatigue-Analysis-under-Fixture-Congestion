Project:Player & Team Fatigue Analysis under Fixture Congestion

Objective:
The objective of this analysis is to understand how fixture congestion (short rest periods between matches)
affects football team performance and to identify whether team quality and physical attributes help teams
cope better under congested schedules.

Key Insights:
1. Teams experience a decline in performance as rest days decrease.
2. High fixture congestion negatively impacts both goals scored and goals conceded.
3. Teams with higher overall quality show better resilience under congested schedules.
4. Strong physical attributes such as sprint speed, strength, and reactions reduce the performance drop
   during periods of high congestion.
5. Not all teams are affected equally — some teams consistently perform better under workload pressure.
6. Certain seasons show higher match density, increasing fatigue-related performance risks.

Business Recommendations:
1. Fixture schedules should minimize short-rest matches where possible.
2. Teams should prioritize squad rotation during congested periods.
3. Investment in physical conditioning and squad depth can improve congestion resilience.
4. Continuous monitoring of workload indicators can help prevent performance decline.
5. Data-driven workload planning provides a competitive advantage over long seasons.

Conclusion:
Fixture congestion has a measurable negative impact on football team performance. However, teams with
strong physical profiles and higher quality are better equipped to manage congested schedules. Effective
workload management can significantly improve competitive outcomes.
